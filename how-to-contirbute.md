This repository primarily contains the sample code for How-To scenarios, proof of concepts and PowerShell scripts for the below technologies:

* azure-api-management 
* azure-cloud-services 
* azure-policy 
* azure-search 
* azure-arm 
* azure-arm-templates
* azure-blockchain 
* azure-batch
* azure-storage

* azure-service-bus 
* azure-service-fabric
* azure-notificationhub 
* azure-eventhub 
* azure-event-grid 
* azure-relay 

## **How can I contribute ?**
1. Create a profile in GitHub
1. Login to GitHub with your account, Navigate to the Code Repository in GitHub
1. Create your own fork and contribute your changes in this fork.
1. Create PULL Requests of your contributions to Code Repository for review.
1. The CORE Team admins will review your PULL requests and merge it. They may also propose changes depending on the content.

## **Guidelines of Code Repository**
- The content must be FRESH and relevant to the technology which is still in support lifecycle.
- Don’t copy the contents / snippets from any other GitHub / third party articles.
- Mention the relevant reference article / code changes while you create PULL requests.
- Follow coding best practices to make it easy for the developers to understand the code / script.
- Refer these language specific best practices:

   [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
  
   [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/community/contributing/powershell-style-guide?view=powershell-7.3)
  
   [Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)

   [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html)
   
   [NodeJS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-beginners-tutorial)
  
Please provide brief description about the scripts/code snippets and add relevant comments wherever applicable.
If there are any pre-requisites or dependencies needed for the code to run, please mention the same. Avoid committing entire solution/project for a single program/file. Strictly follow proper file naming conventions and add file extension to make it search friendly for other engineers and customers:

- C# (DotNet): FileName.cs
  
- PowerShell: ScriptFile.ps1
  
- NodeJS: scriptfile.js or scriptfile.ts
  
- Python: python.py or python_script.py
  
- Java: FileName.java
  
 Code is read much more often than it is written. The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of our repository.

 Most importantly don’t forget to add the “DISCLAIMER” note at top of your script/code snippets. You can use the one suggested below:
